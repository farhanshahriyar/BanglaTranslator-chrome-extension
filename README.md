üìù Project Overview
---------------------------------------------
TransBanglaWebExt is a Chrome extension designed to make the web more accessible for Bangla-speaking users.

## üî® What I Built

**This project is a user-friendly Chrome extension that:**  

-	Automatically detects visible English text on any webpage.
-	Translates the content from English to Bangla using the MyMemory API.
-	Allows users to toggle translation via a simple popup interface with a "Translate to Bangla" button.

## üìú Explanation

This extension leverages the Chrome extension APIs, JavaScript, and the MyMemory API to provide real-time, on-page translations. When activated, it scans the webpage for text elements, translates the English content to Bangla, and updates the page without needing to reload it.

**Core Functionalities**

- **Popup UI**: A user-friendly interface that provides a "Translate to Bangla" button to activate the translation.
- **Content Script Execution**: JavaScript code that scans text elements on the active webpage and replaces English text with translated Bangla text.
